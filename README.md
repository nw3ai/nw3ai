- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethMaven

**Summary:**
create a meme stocks dashboard
grassroots community can weigh in to improve the culture and trends of how we communicate about meme stocks--using our authenticity and humor...
subvert toxic pump/dump, scams and the other BS.... 

**Problem: **
We’ve had pump/dumps, faux promoters, scammers, rug pulls and with the meme stocks—I say this is a great test to improve a piece of our community that everyone feels sucks a great deal and is predatory and downright toxic to get people to buy/hodl to and dump isn’t the culture this community can thrive around.

**Obeservation:**
If you look at the data from public spaces around meme stocks you’ll find an echo chamber of the same demographics repeating what they want to hear back to each other. This eliminates other key demos for growth, derives newcomers and is toxic as they won’t allow dissent or questions in cases. Last night I heard toxic, cult, religion around a guy who is a “genius” marketing person and does it “all on his own.” I raised questions if they looked at indicators accounts use to fool us into believing they are popular and was the only woman speaker and shut down and unwelcome. 


**Goals:**
1. Benchmark views over time periods (week/day/hour) similar to candle sticks 
2. Use Twitter opensource data or transcribe spaces to code “hype” eg, last night’s Space would have been cult, toxic, religion, etc.  these can be like the old vintage race horses at the circus you shoot with a water gun—each one needs a design fitting for the term and relevant to the grassroots community. It’s a nod and irreverent to dissuade—not to be mean or expose people in categories for example. Community propose and vote on terms. 
3. People speak about these creators like they are gods and defend them to points of insanity or can’t get people to notice they are in fact scammers; to curb this worship on a high or low score would be measurement, need the right language. Have the community vote on term.
4. Can defend against bot attacks 
5. Consider does it scrape public twitter data for terms?
6. Do we keep historical record of these founders — snapshot of scores on launch, spike and post day that can be measured over multiple projects over time?
